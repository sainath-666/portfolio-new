NOTES FOR CHATBOT DEVELOPMENT / INTEGRATION TIPS
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Preferred structured format: Provide both a human-readable text version (this file) and a machine-readable JSON file (export of the same info). If you want, I can generate a JSON variant next.
2) Prioritize these fields for quick answers:
   - name, short name, roles, location, email
   - social URLs (GitHub, LinkedIn, WhatsApp)
   - top skills (React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind)
   - 3–6 featured projects (title, 1-sentence description, live, github)
   - education summary
3) Content provenance: Cite source file (e.g., "About.jsx" or "src/data/projects.js") when answering to explain where data came from.
4) Updates: When updating the repo content (About/skills/projects), regenerate this file or use an automated script to extract data programmatically.
5) Example user prompts for the chatbot:
   - "Tell me about Sainathreddy's experience and skills."
   - "Show me Sainathreddy's top 3 projects with links."
   - "How to contact Sainathreddy?"
